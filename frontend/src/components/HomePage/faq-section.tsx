      question: "Can I use Atlas for more than one goal at the same time?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use Atlas for multiple goals simultaneously. Each goal will have its own mindmap, schedule, and progress tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my daily routine changes a lot?",
      answer: "It adjusts schedules automatically when things shift, whether you sleep late, have a busy day, or need to pause a task, it reschedules everything without you stressing over it.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I skip a day or miss tasks?",
      answer:
        "Life happens. And Atlas gets that. It reschedules missed tasks intelligently and keeps your overall progress on track. I donâ€™t need to drag things around manually."},
    {
      question: "Can I control how detailed the plan is?",
      answer:
        "Definitely. When you start a goal, you can choose whether you want a quick overview, a mid-level breakdown, or a deep dive. Atlas adjusts the number of subtasks and the overall timeline based on that.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Atlas useful beyond just studying or work?",
      answer: "Yes, you can use it to plan personal goals too, like learning guitar, prepping for a trip, or tracking creative projects.",
